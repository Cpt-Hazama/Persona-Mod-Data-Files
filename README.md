# Persona Mod .DAT Files
Since Garry doesn't allow files such as .txt, .dat, etc to the workshop :/ I have to upload these else where...

# Basic Installation

- Press the big green button that says "Code"
- Press "Download Zip"
- Navigate to "common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons/"
- Drag and drop (or unzip) the "Persona-Mod-Data-Files-master" folder into the above directory
- Done.

# Proper Installation

I'm not going to go over how to use the "GitHub Desktop" app, you can look it up easily. With the app, you can easily install this repository and get updates instantly with the press of a single button. It's much easier than re-downloading this anytime there is an update.
